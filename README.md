## 1. Introduction
This instruction file provides a step-by-step guide for web scraping using Scrapy in your Blackcoffer project. Scrapy is a powerful web crawling and scraping framework written in Python.

## 2. Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python programming.
- Familiarity with HTML and CSS selectors.

## 3. Installation
Ensure you have Python and pip installed. Install Scrapy using the following command:

```bash
pip install scrapy
```

## 4. Creating a Scrapy Project
Open your terminal and navigate to the desired directory for your project. Run the following command to create a new Scrapy project:

```bash
scrapy startproject project_name
```

## 5. Defining Items
In the `items.py` file within your Scrapy project, define the items you want to scrape and store. Items are similar to data structures that hold the scraped data.

## 6. Creating Spiders
Spiders are the heart of Scrapy. They define how to perform the crawling and scraping. Create a spider by running:

```bash
scrapy genspider spider_name domain_to_scrape
```

## 7. Extracting Data
Inside your spider's code, define how to extract data from the website's HTML using CSS or XPath selectors. Use `response.css()` or `response.xpath()`.

## 8. Storing the Scraped Data
Define how you want to store the scraped data. You can use pipelines to process and store the scraped data, such as in CSV, JSON, or databases.

## 9. Running the Spider
To run your spider, use the following command:

```bash
scrapy crawl spider_name
```

## 10. Conclusion
By following these steps, you have successfully completed the web scraping process using Scrapy for your Blackcoffer project. 

This instruction file should guide you through the process of setting up a Scrapy project, creating spiders, extracting data, and storing the scraped information. Remember to respect website terms of use and ethical scraping practices while scraping data.

# 1. Sentiment Analysis
### 1.1 Cleaning using Stop Words Lists
- Preprocess the scraped text data using techniques like tokenization, lowercasing, and removing punctuation.
- Remove commonly occurring stop words using predefined lists or libraries like NLTK.
  
### 1.2 Creating a Dictionary of Positive and Negative Words
- Compile lists of positive and negative words for sentiment analysis. These lists can be obtained from various sources.
- Assign sentiment scores to these words based on their polarity.

### 1.3 Extracting Derived Variables
- Calculate sentiment scores for each piece of preprocessed text based on the created dictionaries.
- Determine the overall sentiment of the text based on the aggregated sentiment scores.

## 2. Analysis of Readability
### 2.1 Average Number of Words Per Sentence
- Calculate the average number of words per sentence to understand the text's complexity and readability.

### 2.2 Complex Word Count
- Identify complex words using heuristics such as the number of syllables or characters.
- Count the occurrences of complex words within the text.

### 2.3 Word Count
- Count the total number of words in the preprocessed text.

### 2.4 Syllable Count Per Word
- Calculate the average syllable count per word to assess the text's complexity.

### 2.5 Personal Pronouns
- Identify and count personal pronouns in the text to gain insights into the writer's perspective.

### 2.6 Average Word Length
- Calculate the average length of words in the preprocessed text.

## 3. Conclusion
By following these steps, you have successfully completed the Blackcoffer Web Scraping using Scrapy and Sentiment Analysis Project.
